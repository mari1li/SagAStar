This is a simulation of the stars orbiting the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy, Milky Way. 
This was my personal project to use the orbit of these stars to validate the mass of the supermassive black hole I collected from a database. 
The code was inspired by Tech with Tim's Planet simulation: https://youtu.be/WTLPmUHTPqo?si=WNF3v5UAZzC16VvV
